I am a front-end developer focused on developing myself in creating web softwares of high quality and websites.

I worked with ecommerce softwares, using front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and SASS, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap/Materialize and tools like Gulp.js, Git/GitHub and Firebase.

Besides working with the creation of responsive interfaces focused on faithful reproduction of design (Pixel Perfect), and to use UX concepts to optimize the ecommerce performance, breaking frustrations, decreasing the dropout rate and then increasing the conversion rate.

I have interest for working with software development and for build solutions that bring positive experiences and make the life easier for everyone.
